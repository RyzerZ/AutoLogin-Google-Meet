# AutoLogin
AutoLogin in Google Meet with Python (Google Accounts without 2-step verification)

# How to use
This program written in Python needs to install the following plugins with pip:
* [ChromeWebDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) - *The one that correspond with ur installed chrome version.*
* Selenium
* Pynput
* Pause

You will have to copy the ChromeWebDriver to the Python installation folder

```sh
$ pip install selenium
$ pip install pynput
$ pip install pause
```
```sh
$ python login.py
```

# Path of python
In a terminal, execute the following commands
```sh
$ import os
$ import sys
$ os.path.dirname(sys.executable)
```

# Why
Due to the coronavirus, many people require virtual classes, which we can have problems accessing 
on schedule, so I have created this script to get rid of problems.
